📦 Demand Forecasting for E-Commerce

This project focuses on predicting future product demand using historical sales data combined with Google clicks and Facebook impressions. The goal is to help businesses optimize inventory, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction.

🧠 Problem Statement

E-commerce faces fluctuating demand influenced by seasons, marketing, and consumer behavior. Without accurate forecasting, businesses risk stockouts or overstocking, causing lost revenue and higher costs.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed sales trends, patterns, and relationships in the data.

Feature Engineering: Created features like day, month, season, and marketing metrics to improve model accuracy.

Model Development: Built machine learning models including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, ARIMA, and Prophet.

Model Evaluation: Measured performance using metrics like RMSE, MAPE, and MAE to find the best model.

Visualization and Reporting: Visualized predicted vs actual demand and created reports for business decisions.
